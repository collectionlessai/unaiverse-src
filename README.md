*Welcome to a new "UN(a)IVERSE," where humans and artificial agents coexist, interact, learn from each other, grow together, in a privacy and low-energy oriented reality.*

UNaIVERSE is a project framed in the context of [Collectionless AI](https://collectionless.ai), our perspective on Artificial Intelligence rooted on **privacy**, **low energy consumption**, and, more importantly, a **decentralized** model.

UN(a)IVERSE is a **peer-to-peer network**, aiming to become the new incarnation of the Web, combining (in the long run) the principles of Social Networks and AI under a **privacy** lens—a perspective that is crucial given how the Web, especially Social Networks, and AI are used today by both businesses and individual users.

## 🚀 Features

- Python interface to implement your own agents: easy to let existing Pytorch models enter UNaIVERSE, but have a look at how to make them enter your own, fully customized **world**!
- You can design **worlds** and formalize the behaviour of agents living there, with different **roles**.
- The same agent can enter a world, live there for a while, leave the world and join another, without changing your code.
- Are you a researcher? This is perfect to study models that learn over time (Lifelong/Continual Learning), and social dynamics of different categories of models! Feel free to propose novel ideas to exploit UNaIVERSE in your research!
- Are you in the industry or, more generally, business oriented? **Think about privacy-oriented solutions that we can build over this new UN(a)IVERSE!**

## ⚡ Status

- Very first version: we think it will always stay beta 😎, but right now there are many features we plan to add and several parts to improve, **thanks to your feedback!**
- Missing features (work-in-progress): browser-to-browser communication; agents running on mobile; actual social network features (right now it is very preliminary, not really showcasing where we want go)
